## 4.0.2 Hotfix
- Fixed XML docs not included in NuGet leading to no intellesense. (Closes #44)
- Fixed RawTexture.Height property being internal by making it public (Closes #45)

## 4.0.3 Hotfix
- Fixed crash in `TextureAtlas.FromRaw` where loop for slices used incorrect iterator. (Closes #52)

## 4.0.4 Hotfix
- `AnimatedSprite.Update(float)` changed to `AnimatedSprite.Update(double)` (Closes #51)
- `AnimatedTilemap.Update(float)` changed to `AnimatedTilemap.Update(double)` (Closes #51)
- `AnimatedSprite.Update(double)` and `AnimatedTilemap.Update(double)` now expect the value being passed to be a representation of elapsed seconds and not elapsed milliseconds.  This is in-line with the common use case of delta time being representative of seconds elapsed and not milliseconds elapsed. (Closes #61)

## 4.0.5 Hotfix
- `Slice.Origin` value is not set property in constructor. (Closes #64)

## 4.0.6 Hotfix
- Removed package dependency on DesktopGL (Closes #66)
