</h1>

**Monogame.Aseprite** is a free and open source library for the [MonoGame Framework](https://monogame.net) that assists in importing [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org) files into your game project.  No need to export a spritesheet from Aseprite and have to deal with a PNG + JSON import.  With **MonoGame.Aseprite**, you can use the Aseprite file directly.

# Features
- **MonoGame.Aseprite** internally uses [AsepriteDotNet](https://github.com/AristurtleDev/AsepriteDotNet) to read and parse the aseprite files.  This means you get all the features of AsepriteDotNet including
    - Supports Aseprite files using **RGBA**, **Grayscale**, and **Indexed** color modes.
    - Supports all Aseprite layer blend modes.
    - Supports Aseprite tilesets, tilemap layers, and tilemap cels.
- Provides processors to convert the Aseprite data into common formats including:
    - Sprite
    - SpriteSheet
    - TextureAtlas
    - Tileset
    - Tilemap
    - AnimatedTilemap


# Installation

# Usage
Please refer to the [Examples](./examples) directory for samples of how to use this library.  Each example is thoroughly commented with information to show you how to load the Aseprite file and use it within Monogame.
