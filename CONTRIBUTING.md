How To Contribute To SmtpKit
</h1>

Contributions are made to this repository via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).  The following are some general guidelines that cover both of these methods.  More specific guidelines are covered in their respective sections below.

*   Issues and Pull requests should abide by the Code of Conduct
*   Ensure that hte Issue or Pull Request has not already been created by searching for them on GitHub on the Issues and Pull Requests pages.
*   While all attempts at handling Issues and PulL Requests are attempted in a timely manner, sometimes it can take a while to investigate the problem and come to a resolution.  If your Issue or Pull Request has not been updated and seems to be stalling, it is ok to do a single ping in the comment thread as a friendly reminder.

## Issues
The [Issues](https://github.com/AristurtleDev/SmtpKit/issues) page should be used to **report any problems with the library, request a new feature be added, or discuss potential changes before a Pull Request is created**.  When creating a new issue, a template will be loaded to guide you through collecting and providing the information needed to investigate. 

If you find an existing issue that addresses the same problem you are having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.

## Pull Requests
Pull Requests to this library are always welcome.  Pull Requests that are approved will be added to the next release of this library.  In general, Pull Requests should:

*   Only fix or add the functionality in question.
*   Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines possible.
*   Include documentation.
*   Follow all code formatting guidelines specific for this repository.
*   Be accompanied by a completed Pull Request template, which is loaded automatically when the Pull Request is created.

For any changes that affect core functionality, or would be considered a breaking change (e.g. a major release), it is best to open an Issue to discuss the proposal first.  While this is not required, it can help by saving time creating and reviewing the changes.

When creating a Pull Request, you should use the "fork and pull workflow":

1.  Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  Clone the project locally to your machine.
3.  Create a new branch locally with a short, but descriptive, name.
4.  Commit changes to the branch.
5.  Follow any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repository.
6.  Push changes to your fork.
7.  Open a Pull Request in this repository and follow the Pull Request template so that the change can be efficiently reviewed.
