How To Contribute To MonoGame.Aseprite
</h1>

Contributions are made to this repository via Issues.  The following are some general guidelines that cover both of these methods.  More specific guidelines are covered in their respective sections below.

*   Issues should abide by the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
*   Ensure that the issue has not already been created by searching for them on GitHub on the [issues](https://github.com/AristurteDev/monogame-aseprite/issues) page.
*   While all attempts at handling issues are attempted in a timely manner, sometimes it can take a while to investigate the problem and come to a resolution.  If your issue has not been updated and seems to be stalling, it is ok to do a single ping in the comment thread as a friendly reminder.

## Issues
The [Issues](https://github.com/AristurtleDev/monogame-aseprite/issues) page should be used to **report any problems with the library, request a new feature be added, or discuss potential changes before a Pull Request is created**.  When creating a new issue, a template will be loaded to guide you through collecting and providing the information needed to investigate. 

If you find an existing issue that addresses the same problem you are having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.

## Pull Requests
I am currently not accepting pull requests.  This will change in the future, but first I need a better workflow for CI/CD and automating tasks such as build/test/pack through GitHub actions.  This library does use cake to automate much of it, but I need to future proof it first before opening up pull requests.

## Questions
Do you have any questions on how to use this library, or questions about the source code?  Reach out with your question in the [Q&A Discussions](https://github.com/AristurtleDev/monogame-aseprite/discussions/categories/q-a) page.

## Code of Conduct
This project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) to outline the expected behavior in our community.  See the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more specific information.
